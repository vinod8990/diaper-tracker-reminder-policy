# Privacy Policy

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how **Diaper Tracker & Reminder** (the **"App"** or **"we"**) collects, uses, and protects your information.

We are committed to the security and confidentiality of your data. The core principle of this policy is: **Your personal tracking data never leaves your device.**


## 2. Information We Do NOT Collect

We are an anonymous service and do not create user accounts. We **do not collect, store, or transmit** any of the following types of information to our servers or third parties:

* **Personal Information (PII):** We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, location data, or any other data that can directly identify you or your child.
* **Diaper Log Data:** We do not collect or transmit your log entries, usage dates, counts, or notes.
* **Calculated Statistics:** We do not collect your calculated averages, days left, or predicted empty dates.


## 3. Information Collected (Local Only)

All log data and information required to provide the core functionality of the App are stored **only on your device** (locally) using local storage methods (e.g., SwiftData or CoreData).

| Type of Information | Purpose | Storage Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Diaper Log Entries** (date, type, count, note) | To provide stock tracking, average usage calculations, and future prediction features. | **Your Device Only** |
| **Basket/Item Metadata** (name, total, icon) | To allow users to organize and track multiple items. | **Your Device Only** |

**Data Integrity:** If you delete the App or wipe your device's data, all associated log data will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered by us.


## 4. Information Handled by App Stores (Payments & Analytics)

Since the App is distributed via mobile app platforms (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store), certain information is handled by the platform itself:

* **Subscription Information:** Purchases and subscription details (payment methods, renewal dates, transaction IDs) are processed and managed entirely by the respective App Store and are subject to their privacy policies. We **do not** have access to your full payment details.
* **Device Identifiers:** The platform may provide us with basic, anonymized, and aggregated analytics related to app performance (e.g., crash reports, device model, operating system version). This data is typically anonymized and is used solely for improving app stability and performance.


## 5. Third-Party Access

Due to our commitment to local-only data storage, **we do not share or sell your log data or personal tracking information with any third parties** for advertising, marketing, or any other purpose.


## 6. Children’s Privacy

The App is intended for use by **parents and adult caregivers** (aged 18 and over). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a child, we will delete that information immediately.


## 7. Governing Law

This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of **India**, and any disputes will be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in **Kochi (Kerala), India.**


## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on the app store listing page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.
